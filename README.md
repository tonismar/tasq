A corporative task manager to learn Zend.

This project will be:
	- a web interface to
		- manager users (admin)
		- manager users tasks (admin)
		- webservice server side to provide information to the mobile interface

	- a mobile interface to
		- manager a especific user logged
		- update a especific user information
			

Initially I choosed to the mobile interface just one user per cell phone. 
This way It will do less network traffic, only the new single user information will be received.
